### Featured Knowledge Graphs

#### [Game of Thrones](https://graphhub.net/game-of-thrones)

The Game of Thrones graph includes the expected lists of characters, locations, and major events that make up the wonderful world and story of GoT. It also includes less covered items like groups, religions, dragons, famous quotes, and much more.

#### [Text To Image](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image)

The 'text-to-image' graph is a definitive guide for users of tools such as Midjourney, DALLE-2, Stable Diffusion, or similar AIs. This chart presents a mapping of art styles, lighting, colors, moods, and renowned entities, assisting in crafting prompts that yield predictable and consistent results.

## How It Works

GraphHub is the perfect place to start mapping knowledge in a structured, collaborative, and discoverable manner!

1. Map Your Concepts: Start out simple by adding all concepts in your specific domain and giving each one a basic description.

2. Add Relationships Using Lists: When concepts share common traits such as their type or classification, create a list to group them together.

3. Get More Specific: Now that you have mapped your basic concepts and relationships, create detailed documentation for your critical assets using standardized Markdown language.

4. Build Complex Relationships: Start including lists within each other to create hierarchies and inheritance.

## Planned Features & Timeline

- Image: Creation of image concepts. Images can be assigned to concepts as 'related images'. Expected: Aug 2023.
- Event: Creation of event concepts. Events can be assigned to concepts as 'related events'. Expected: Sep 2023.
- Timeline: Creation of timeline container type. Events can be assigned to timelines as 'members'. Timelines can be assigned to concepts as 'related timelines'. Timelines can pull and push events to other timelines like lists. Expected: TBD.
- Entities and Fields: Creation of entity data type. Creation of attribute data type. Entities can be assigned attributes with a specific quantity. Entities can push and pull attributes from other entities. Expected: TBD.
