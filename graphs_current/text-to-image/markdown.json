Wells, and Mary Shelley. Initially, it was a sub[genre](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/list/genre?id=1065) of [science fiction](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/science-fiction?id=1119) that merged [historical](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/historical?id=1044) elements with anachronistic technological features inspired by [science fiction](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/science-fiction?id=1119). The term \u0022[steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271)\u0022 was coined by [author](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/list/author?id=1061) [K.W. Jeter](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/kw-jeter?id=1750) as a [playful](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/playful?id=1414) variation of \u0022[cyberpunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/cyberpunk?id=1269),\u0022 another popular [genre](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/list/genre?id=1065) at the time.\r\n\r\n[Steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271)\u0027s influence extended beyond literature and quickly found its way into [various](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/various?id=1072) forms of artistic expression. It drew inspiration from the [Industrial](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/industrial?id=1759) Revolution, Victorian-era Britain, the American Wild West, and the rise of steam power. Today, [Steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) is a [vibrant](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/vibrant?id=279) art style that permeates movies, [fashion](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/list/fashion?id=1052), music, visual arts, and even technology.\r\n\r\n#### Key Elements of [Steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) Art Style\r\n\r\n##### Machinery and Technology\r\n[Steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) art prominently features machinery and technology, especially those powered by steam. Artists often incorporate gears, cogs, gauges, and analog devices in their works. This extends to flying machines, [fantastical](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/fantastical?id=1041) submarines, and [mechanical](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/mechanical?id=1115) prosthetics, emphasizing the interaction between humans and technology.\r\n\r\n##### Victorian Aesthetics\r\nDespite its focus on technology, [steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) incorporates Victorian [fashion](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/list/fashion?id=1052) and [design](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/design?id=1315) elements, evoking a [nostalgic](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/nostalgic?id=1452) longing for an era of elegance and craftsmanship. Corsets, top hats, tailcoats, and goggles are common, as are intricate patterns, lace, and embroidery. Brass, copper, glass, and wood are prominent materials in both [steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) [fashion](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/list/fashion?id=1052) and architecture.\r\n\r\n##### Retro-[futurism](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/futurism?id=1114)\r\n[Steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) art presents an alternate history or parallel universe where [modern](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/modern?id=1588) technologies exist in the past, typically during the 19th century. This retro-[futuristic](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/futuristic?id=1057) vision showcases inventions and devices that are far ahead of their time, created with the materials and aesthetics of the Victorian era.\r\n\r\n##### Adventure and Exploration\r\n[Steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271)\u0027s literary roots in the [speculative fiction](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/speculative-fiction?id=1754) of Verne and Wells contribute to a spirit of adventure and exploration within the style. This may be portrayed through grand airships, elaborate submarines, or [mysterious](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/mysterious?id=1102) and exotic locations.\r\n\r\n##### Ornate Detailing\r\nElaborate detailing is a significant characteristic of [steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) [design](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/design?id=1315), reflecting the Victorian love for decoration and craftsmanship. Artists pay attention to even the minutest details, incorporating ornate gears, cogs, and filigree on [clothing](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/clothing?id=337) and buildings.\r\n\r\n##### [Industrial](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/industrial?id=1759) Influence\r\nThe [Industrial](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/industrial?id=1759) Revolution plays a crucial role in shaping the [steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) aesthetic, emphasizing manufacturing, [mechanical](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/mechanical?id=1115) engineering, and [raw](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/raw?id=1176) materials like iron and steel. This can be seen in art featuring imposing factories, [industrial](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/industrial?id=1759) landscapes, or heavy machinery.\r\n\r\n##### The Color Palette\r\n[Steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) art employs a specific color palette, favoring sepia, brown, black, brass, and copper hues. These [colors](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/list/colors?id=7) contribute to a sense of antiquity and a gritty, soot-covered [industrial](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/industrial?id=1759) atmosphere.\r\n\r\n##### Dichotomy\r\nA core element of [steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) is the contrast between the [mechanical](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/mechanical?id=1115) and the organic, the [historical](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/historical?id=1044) and the [futuristic](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/futuristic?id=1057), and the [industrial](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/industrial?id=1759) and the elegant. This tension adds [depth](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/depth?id=1777) and complexity to [steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) art, creating a world that is simultaneously familiar and foreign.\r\n\r\n### Example Propmpts\r\n\r\n#### [Steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) Goggles\r\n![Steampunk Goggles Midjourney Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1057967671188135936/1126410897586405417/haidi_steampunk_goggles_burning_man_stylish_in_the_desert_Black_3efebb2e-e09b-4f33-856d-6ef4c1afd106.png \u0022Steampunk Goggles\u0022)\r\n\u003E AI: **MidJourney**\r\n\u003E Prompt: \u0060steampunk goggles, burning man, stylish, in the desert, Black rock city, high detail\u0060\r\n\r\n#### [Steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) Engineer\r\n![Steampunk Engineer Midjourney Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1057967671188135936/1126410837368770611/haidi_steampunk_female_engineer_boarding_airship_with_gear_very_dcb64415-5668-4896-9673-bb3b680c7a71.png \u0022Steampunk Engineer\u0022)\r\n\u003E AI: **MidJourney**\r\n\u003E Prompt: \u0060steampunk goggles, burning man, stylish, in the desert, Black rock city, high detail\u0060\r\n\r\n#### [Steampunk](https://graphhub.net/text-to-image/concept/steampunk?id=271) Machine\r\n![Steampunk Machine Midjourney Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1057967671188135936/1126410940020183121/haidi_Steampunk_perpetuum_mobile_light_bulbs_bronze_gears_smoke_d80a548f-b53a-4550-b57d-53ed0edc2bb0.png \u0022Steampunk Machine\u0022)\r\n\u003E AI: **MidJourney**\r\n\u003E Prompt: \u0060steampunk goggles, burning man, stylish, in the desert, Black rock city, high detail\u0060"
