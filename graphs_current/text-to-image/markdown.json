    "Markdown": "#### Origins and Influences of Steampunk\r\n\r\nSteampunk originated in the 1980s, but its foundations can be traced back to nineteenth-century speculative fiction, particularly the works of pioneering authors like Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and Mary Shelley. Initially, it was a subgenre of science fiction that merged historical elements with anachronistic technological features inspired by science fiction. The term \u0022steampunk\u0022 was coined by author K.W. Jeter as a playful variation of \u0022cyberpunk,\u0022 another popular genre at the time.\r\n\r\nSteampunk\u0027s influence extended beyond literature and quickly found its way into various forms of artistic expression. It drew inspiration from the Industrial Revolution, Victorian-era Britain, the American Wild West, and the rise of steam power. Today, Steampunk is a vibrant art style that permeates movies, fashion, music, visual arts, and even technology.\r\n\r\n#### Key Elements of Steampunk Art Style\r\n\r\n##### Machinery and Technology\r\nSteampunk art prominently features machinery and technology, especially those powered by steam. Artists often incorporate gears, cogs, gauges, and analog devices in their works. This extends to flying machines, fantastical submarines, and mechanical prosthetics, emphasizing the interaction between humans and technology.\r\n\r\n##### Victorian Aesthetics\r\nDespite its focus on technology, steampunk incorporates Victorian fashion and design elements, evoking a nostalgic longing for an era of elegance and craftsmanship. Corsets, top hats, tailcoats, and goggles are common, as are intricate patterns, lace, and embroidery. Brass, copper, glass, and wood are prominent materials in both steampunk fashion and architecture.\r\n\r\n##### Retro-futurism\r\nSteampunk art presents an alternate history or parallel universe where modern technologies exist in the past, typically during the 19th century. This retro-futuristic vision showcases inventions and devices that are far ahead of their time, created with the materials and aesthetics of the Victorian era.\r\n\r\n##### Adventure and Exploration\r\nSteampunk\u0027s literary roots in the speculative fiction of Verne and Wells contribute to a spirit of adventure and exploration within the style. This may be portrayed through grand airships, elaborate submarines, or mysterious and exotic locations.\r\n\r\n##### Ornate Detailing\r\nElaborate detailing is a significant characteristic of steampunk design, reflecting the Victorian love for decoration and craftsmanship. Artists pay attention to even the minutest details, incorporating ornate gears, cogs, and filigree on clothing and buildings.\r\n\r\n##### Industrial Influence\r\nThe Industrial Revolution plays a crucial role in shaping the steampunk aesthetic, emphasizing manufacturing, mechanical engineering, and raw materials like iron and steel. This can be seen in art featuring imposing factories, industrial landscapes, or heavy machinery.\r\n\r\n##### The Color Palette\r\nSteampunk art employs a specific color palette, favoring sepia, brown, black, brass, and copper hues. These colors contribute to a sense of antiquity and a gritty, soot-covered industrial atmosphere.\r\n\r\n##### Dichotomy\r\nA core element of steampunk is the contrast between the mechanical and the organic, the historical and the futuristic, and the industrial and the elegant. This tension adds depth and complexity to steampunk art, creating a world that is simultaneously familiar and foreign.\r\n\r\n### Example Propmpts\r\n\r\n#### Steampunk Goggles\r\n![Steampunk Goggles Midjourney Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1057967671188135936/1126410897586405417/haidi_steampunk_goggles_burning_man_stylish_in_the_desert_Black_3efebb2e-e09b-4f33-856d-6ef4c1afd106.png \u0022Steampunk Goggles\u0022)\r\n\u003E AI: **MidJourney**\r\n\u003E Prompt: \u0060steampunk goggles, burning man, stylish, in the desert, Black rock city, high detail\u0060\r\n\r\n#### Steampunk Engineer\r\n![Steampunk Engineer Midjourney Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1057967671188135936/1126410837368770611/haidi_steampunk_female_engineer_boarding_airship_with_gear_very_dcb64415-5668-4896-9673-bb3b680c7a71.png \u0022Steampunk Engineer\u0022)\r\n\u003E AI: **MidJourney**\r\n\u003E Prompt: \u0060steampunk goggles, burning man, stylish, in the desert, Black rock city, high detail\u0060\r\n\r\n#### Steampunk Machine\r\n![Steampunk Machine Midjourney Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1057967671188135936/1126410940020183121/haidi_Steampunk_perpetuum_mobile_light_bulbs_bronze_gears_smoke_d80a548f-b53a-4550-b57d-53ed0edc2bb0.png \u0022Steampunk Machine\u0022)\r\n\u003E AI: **MidJourney**\r\n\u003E Prompt: \u0060steampunk goggles, burning man, stylish, in the desert, Black rock city, high detail\u0060"
